Hi, my name is Bilal. I am a data scientist. I work mostly in Python, R, SQL, and Spark.

Prior to becoming a data scientist I worked as an Assistant Professor at [LUMS](https://www.lums.edu.pk/) for a few years where I taught game theory and mathematical methods in economics.

In the summers, I teach probability and game theory to gifted high school students at the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading non-fiction and keeping up with the English Premier League.
