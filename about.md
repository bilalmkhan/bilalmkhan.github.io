Hi, my name is Bilal. I am a data scientist. I work mostly in Python, R, SQL, and Spark.

Currently, I am a Data Science Fellow at the [Insight Data Science Fellowship Program](https://insightfellows.com/data-science) in Seattle. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at Microsoft on contract and used natural language processing and deep learning to classify travel blogs.

After finishing my PhD in economics, I worked as an Assistant Professor at [LUMS](https://www.lums.edu.pk/) for a few years where I taught game theory and mathematical methods in economics.

In the summers, I teach probability and game theory to gifted high school students at the [Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth](https://cty.jhu.edu/).

In my spare time, I enjoy reading non-fiction and keeping up with the English Premier League.
