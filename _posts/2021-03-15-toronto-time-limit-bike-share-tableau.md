title: Should Toronto Increase the 30-Minute Time Limit on Bike Share Rides? 
subtitle: An analysis of Bike Share Toronto 2018 ridership data using Tableau
---

I have become a big fan of Bike Share Toronto after recently moving to the city. The annual membership I purchased allows unlimited 30-minute bike trips for only $99 a year, but you can also purchase a Day Pass for $7 as a casual member. The catch is that if your bike trip exceeds 30 minutes, you get charged extra fees. 

A few days ago, I read [an article](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2020/08/24/bike-share-toronto-is-finally-thriving-and-those-electric-bikes-are-awesome-too.html) in The Star about how the bike sharing service is thriving in Toronto. At the end of the article, the writer requested the city to increase the time limit for bike trips to 45 minutes, arguing the 30 minutes time limit "is starting to feel real tight". The request even got the attention of Toronto City Councillor James Pasternak who tweeted that he would be happy to discuss the proposal and bring it to his committee.

I was curious to see if other users of Bike Share Toronto were also experiencing difficulty due to the 30-minute limit for bike trips. So I downloaded the Bike Share Toronto Ridership Data from [City of Toronto's Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto-ridership-data/) and analyzed it using Tableau. (2018 is the most recent year for which the data is available on the website.)

So what does the data say? 

*The data shows, overwhelmingly, that regular users of the service do not struggle in returning their bikes within the 30-minute time limit.*

Here are my main findings with accompanying data visualizations:

**First, riders with an annual membership are by far the primary users of the service.** They accounted for more than 80 percent of the 1.9 million bike share trips in 2018.  Moreover, a significant percentage of annual members continue using the bikeshare service even during Toronto's harsh winters, whereas casual members barely use the bikeshare service in the winters.

**Second, riders with an annual membership use the service very differently than riders who are casual members.** The data suggests that annual members use the bike sharing service mostly to commute to work, whereas casual members use it recreationally. We can see this from peak usage times for annual members which are morning and evening rush hours and weekdays; for riders who are casual members, peak usage times are evenings and weekends.

Moreover, popular starting stations for annual members are mostly located in the downtown area, whereas popular starting stations for casual members are along the scenic trail parallel to Lake Shore Boulevard.

**Third, the data strongly suggests that the regular users of the service do not struggle in returning their bikes within the 30-minute time limit.** The median bike trip duration for annual members is only 10 minutes. 75 percent of the bike trips by annual members are less than 15 minutes long, and 95 percent of the bike trips by annual members are less than 20 minutes long.

**Lastly, casual members often mistake a "Day Pass" to mean a day-long bike rental rather than unlimited 30 minute rides.** The median bike trip duration for casual members is 20 minutes. However, only 75 percent of the bike trips by casual members are within the 30 minute time limit. This means that one out of every four bike trips by casual members is late and incurs extra fees. Online reviews and Bike Share Toronto's [two-star rating](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g155019-d7071915-Reviews-Bike_Share_Toronto-Toronto_Ontario.html) on TripAdvisor and [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pbsc.bikes&hl=en) suggest that this is primarily because casual members do not understand the 30-minute time limit. We  can see from the data that even if the time limit were increased to 45 minutes, 15 percent of bike trips by casual members would still be late and get charged extra fees.

In conclusion, the ridership data for Bike Share Toronto does not suggest that there is a need for an increase in the 30-minute time limit. Any policy change should be informed by data and should carefully consider if the regular users of the service might be adversely affected.
