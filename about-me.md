Hi, my name is Bilal. I am a [Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer](https://googlecloudcertified.credential.net/profile/2655b7c60bfa2929c649b958843d73de46a50e6c). I live in Toronto, Ontario.

Most recently, I was a Data Science Fellow at the [Insight Data Science Fellowship Program](https://insightfellows.com/data-science). Prior to moving to Canada, I worked as a Data Scientist on contract at Microsoft in Seattle. 

I have a PhD in economics. I have taught mathematical economics at [LUMS](https://www.lums.edu.pk/) and  probability and game theory at the [Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth](https://cty.jhu.edu/).

In my spare time, I enjoy reading nonfiction, exploring Toronto using [BikeShareTO](https://bikesharetoronto.com/) and keeping up with the English Premier League.
