Hi, my name is Bilal. I am a data engineer currently living in Toronto, Canada.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading nonfiction, exploring Toronto using my bicycle and [BikeShareTO](https://bikesharetoronto.com/), and keeping up with the English Premier League.


## Projects

#### [Analyzing Bike Share Toronto Ridership Data with Tableau](https://bilalmkhan.github.io/toronto-time-limit-bike-share-tableau/)
I analyzed the 2018 Bike Share Toronto ridership data using Tableau to explore whether Toronto should increase the 30-minute time limit on bikeshare rides.<br/>

#### [Measuring Workplace Satisfaction from a Large Employee Text Survey](https://github.com/bilalmkhan/insight-project)
I carried out multi-label, multi-class text classification in Python using deep learning and ELMO embeddings to help a client measure employee job satisfaction from a large open ended text survey and presented the findings in a Tableau dashboard.<br/>
