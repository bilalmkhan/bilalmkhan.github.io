Hi, my name is Bilal. I work with data - mostly in Python, SQL, Tableau and Spark. I have more than three years of industry experience working in data analytics. I currently live in Toronto, Ontario.

Currently, I am a Data Science Fellow at the [Insight Data Science Fellowship Program](https://insightfellows.com/data-science). Prior to moving to Canada, I worked as a Data Scientist at Microsoft in Seattle. While in Seattle, I was also a part-time adjunct college instructor teaching the course 'Programming for Machine Learning' at [Bellevue College](https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/).

I have a PhD in economics, and I worked as an Assistant Professor at [LUMS](https://www.lums.edu.pk/) for a few years where I taught game theory and mathematical methods in economics.

In the summers, I teach Probability and Game Theory to gifted high school students at the [Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth](https://cty.jhu.edu/).

In my spare time, I enjoy reading non-fiction and keeping up with the English Premier League.
