Hi, my name is Bilal. I am a data engineer currently living in Toronto, Canada. This is my personal blog which I use to share interesting stories I discover by analyzing and visualizing publicly available open data.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading nonfiction, exploring Toronto on my bicycle and [BikeShareTO](https://bikesharetoronto.com/), and keeping up with the English Premier League.
